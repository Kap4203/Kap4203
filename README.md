I'm a hands-on product leader, I prototype ideas quickly, staying close to the technology. I love helping people navigate where AI, product strategy, and customer-centric innovation intersect. 

I find inspiration in endurance sports. Athletics reminds me that dedication, community, and perseverance are key to moving forwardâ€”whether youâ€™re crossing a finish line or launching a product.
